# Gemini Task: Add Organization-Based Billing Component

## User-Facing Summary

A new "Organization-Based Billing" section was added to the pricing page. This component provides a detailed breakdown of the enterprise billing features, presented in a clear table format, to give potential customers a better understanding of the flexible and scalable pricing options available for organizations.

## Technical Summary

The task was to insert a new UI component into the existing homepage located at `app/page.tsx`.

1.  **File Analysis**: I began by reading `app/page.tsx` to understand its structure and identify the correct insertion point for the new component.
2.  **Component Insertion**: The provided HTML comment and Markdown content were converted into JSX and inserted directly after the main pricing section. This involved creating a new `<section>` and using Tailwind CSS classes to style a table that matched the site's existing design.
3.  **Verification & Correction**: After inserting the code, I attempted to run `npx prettier --write app/page.tsx` to format it. The command failed due to a syntax error.
4.  **Mistake Identification**: The error was a typo in a closing JSX tag: `</endregionContent>` instead of `</AccordionContent>`.
5.  **Resolution**: I corrected the typo using the `replace` tool and re-ran the Prettier command, which then completed successfully.

## Areas for Improvement

The initial implementation failed because of a simple typo. This highlights the importance of careful proofreading before executing verification steps. While the error was quickly resolved, a more thorough initial check could have prevented the failed command execution. In the future, I will be more diligent in reviewing code I write before attempting to format or test it.
